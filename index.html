            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am computer science major, mathematics minor, with a concentration in software development. I dabble in most programming languages and the ones I dont know I can pick up very quickly. I also develop for web applications as well. I am originally from Southern California, but after high school I moved around a lot; living in Philadelpia,PA; Hilo,HA; and Clarksville, TN. I currently live in Clarksville, and am looking for a job in Nashville.</p>
